# Aims

This talk has three aims:

1)  to explore design principles that support pedagogy-first
        approaches to creating question-generating models,
2)  to share considerations and opportunities with respect to having
        students analyse data (with iNZight Lite) to answer quiz
        questions, and
3)  to report on how students are actually using quizzes with
        multiple versions in a large introductory statistics course,
        including findings based on data about quiz attempts, as well as
        reflections from the teaching team.
