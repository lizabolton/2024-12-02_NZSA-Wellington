# Aims

This talk has three aims:

1)  to explore design principles that support pedagogy-first
        approaches to creating question-generating models,
2)  to share considerations and opportunities with respect to having
        students analyse data (with iNZight Lite) to answer quiz
        questions, and
3)  to report on how students are actually using quizzes with
        multiple versions in a large introductory statistics course,
        including findings based on data about quiz attempts, as well as
        reflections from the teaching team.

::: notes
Kia ora koutou ko Liza taku ingoa

I am a professional teaching fellow in the Department of Statistics and
in May this year I was at Southwest University for three weeks teaching
a stage three data science practice course.

# Motivation

::: notes
I have an idea for a bit of a person reflection intro on what we were trying and failing to do in Toronto with version and the experience shifting to methods that felt likely they were punishing good students more than they were preventing cheating, workload was high but also felt a bit pointless

This then ties in to coming back to Auckland and seeing the work Anna was doing on 10x

# Context

## Introduction to Statistics

- *describe the STATS 101/108 context*
- *breifly mention Anna's work in STATS 220, and future development for BIOSCI (Charlotte)*

# Demonstration

## To do?

- Create a little toy demo in free Canvas 
- Synthetic data based on the actual data we have about how students use the quiz would be a fun meta here
- Give the link to iNZight also
- This wouldn't have versions

This part will meet the aim of iNZight considerations and opportunities and has the benefit of introducing some of ideas for aim 3. 

# Design principles & pedagogy

## Question types

Automarked questions tend to come in the following types:

- Identify if a statement is TRUE or FALSE, or complete a statement with the right drop down to make it correct.
  - Recall
  - 
- Write a **number**
  - Recall (a year, a rule of thumb)
  - Identify the number from text
  - Perform a calculation
  - Interact with data
- Write a word
  - Recall

## Question generating models



:::notes
Ideas about getting students to

:::

# So...how does it work in practice?

## To do 

- Do some analyses on the attempt data (check if profiles team has anything fun to add and credit)
- Call back to some of this built out into the quiz

# Reflections

Student use these quizzes for revision quite effectively.

Some student will brute force it to try to get their 10/10 without understanding fully what they're supposed to be doing.

Makes it easier on us when writing portions of the tests and exams as we can draw on styles of question they're very familiar with but put them in the new data context.

# Conclusions

## FAQ

Does this ruin your class average? Nope.

# Next steps

- ðŸ“¦ Working towards a package that would make it easier to write these question generating models in R and then set up the components appropriately for Canvas, Inspera, HTML, etc.

- ðŸ‘¥ Understanding student interaction profiles
