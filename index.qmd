# Course context

::: {.incremental}
- STATS 101/108 is an introductory statistics course
  - *an introduction to using data to learn, identify and solve problems, make decisions, and communicate*
- 1600 to ~2000 students in Semesters 1 and 2 + a summer school offering
- Required for programmes in business and psychology
- üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Teaching teams of 4‚Äì6 lecturers, 8‚Äì10 help room tutors and 15‚Äì20 markers  
- **Major redesign in 2023**

:::

:::notes
This redesign has lots of components, and many aspects of this are part of a wider research project Anna is leading, exploring the impact of technological innovations on assessment practices within large-scale introductory statistics courses. 

It's been awesome to be invited to take part in this research, and in this talk I'm focusing specifically on some details about the new quizzes.
:::

## Quizzes

:::incremental
- 11 total chapter quizzes, for the first 11 (of 12) chapters in the coursebook
- Unlimited attempts
- No time limit
- Low stakes assessment: each worth 1% of the final grade
- Students are encouraged to ask questions and get help with the quizzes in the drop-in help sessions with tutors and peers
:::

::: notes
There are 11 chapter-based quizzes in the course. In a 12 week semester this is a quiz per week and covers the first 11 chapters of the coursebook. Each quiz is designed to cover some aspect of each learning outcome for the the given chapter.

Each quiz opens after the previous one closes and students have unlimited, untimed attempts.

These quizzes are low stakes assessments, worth 1% each.

Because they are heavily versioned, student are not only allowed, but encouraged to come to the drop-in sessions and talk the quizzes over with tutors and their peers.
:::

## An example

```{r, out.height="95%", fig.align = "center", echo = F, caption = "Example Chapter 10 quiz question comparing observed data to simulated null distributions"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/10_3_A_real_29.gif")
```

::: notes
Here is an example of a question addressing a learning outcome about interpretting compatability with a null hypothesis. The student compares the observed data to simulated nulls, as well as considering the tail proportion associated with the test statistic and are asked to make some calls about this. 

Model distributional variation under the null (Chapter 10)
:::


# Question generating models

::: incremental
- There are existing tools like the üì¶ `exams` (e.g., Zeileis et al., 2014) package in R to generate versioned assessments.
- HOW to generate these questions from models is not yet as developed an area.
- As with any model, we need to consider our inputs, outputs and *assumptions*.
  - Quite different vs similar?
  - Visual skew vs calculated kurtosis?
  - The right answer shouldn't always be in the middle ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Median of 3 to 5 attempts per quiz.

For all quizzes 90% of students made under 12.

## Grades

# Reflections

::: incremental
- Student use these quizzes for revision quite effectively.

- Some student will brute force it to try to get their 10/10 without understanding fully what they're supposed to be doing.
  - BUT some students would later use these questions to guide the help they ask for in revision. Helps them be keenly aware of what they are still stumped on.

- Writing portions of the tests and exams are easier (for the teaching team) as we can draw on familiar question styles with new data context.
:::

# Conclusions

:::incremental
- Automation is not really lessening workload here, but it is enabling us to create useful learning tasks with some future proofing.
  - Someone posts answers to all 40 versions online? Rerun the question generating model and get 40 new questions. 
- Almost certainly want to iterate and have some human checking during development.
- ü§ë Putting your "marks where your mouth is" in this way results in student engagement and practice.
:::

# Next steps

- üì¶ Working towards a package that would make it easier to write these question generating models in R and then set up the components appropriately for Canvas, Inspera, HTML, etc.

- üë• Understanding student interaction profiles.

- ‚ùì‚úÖ‚ùå  Developing tools for assessing the difficulty of  these types of questions and quizzes.

# Aims summary {visibility="uncounted"}

This talk had three aims:

1)  to explore design principles that support pedagogy-first
        approaches to creating question-generating models,
2)  to share considerations and opportunities with respect to having
        students analyse data (with iNZight Lite) to answer quiz
        questions, and
3)  to report on how students are actually using quizzes with
        multiple versions in a large introductory statistics course,
        including findings based on data about quiz attempts, as well as reflections from the teaching team.
        
## FAQ {visibility="uncounted"}

*Does this ruin your class average becasue thet all get 10s?* Nope.
<br>
<br>

*Do you do this for the test and exam?* Nope. The current tech support drama of one testing platform is more than enough for high-stakes assessments, so we don't have students use iNZight in the test and exam

:::notes
Low-stakes assessments are a great way to put your marks where your is for how you want students to study and enagage in the course.
